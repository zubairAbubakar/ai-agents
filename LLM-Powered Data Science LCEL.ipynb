    "In today's data-driven world, valuable insights are locked away in spreadsheets and datasets that most professionals don't have the technical skills to analyze. Business owners, managers, and domain experts know their data is valuable but lack the programming knowledge to extract meaningful insights.\n",

    "## About this lab\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will create an AI-powered agent that can help non-technical users perform data science tasks through natural language. You will:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Build a collection of LangChain tools that perform basic data science tasks:\n",
    "   - Listing available datasets\n",
    "   - Loading and analyzing CSV files\n",
    "   - Generating dataset summaries and statistics\n",
    "   - Training and evaluating machine learning models\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Document each tool's purpose and output format clearly to ensure the AI agent can use them effectively\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Demonstrate why regular conversational agents have limitations when working with structured data\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Implement an executor agent that can manage a multi-step workflow for data analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lab, you'll understand how to combine language models with specialized tools to create practical applications that make data science accessible to everyone.\n"

This is because each time the agent runs a tool, it might do so in a separate execution environment, causing any `global` variables to reset. Instead, using a module-level dictionary (`DATAFRAME_CACHE`) that lives outside any function creates a persistent storage space that all tools can access without explicitly passing it around. This approach works reliably across multiple function calls, even when they happen in different contexts, and keeps the function interfaces clean by avoiding the need to pass the cache as an additional parameter to every tool.\n",

    "These tools provide specialized functionality for building and evaluating machine learning models on datasets. The agent will first analyze the dataset structure using previous tools to determine if the prediction task is classification or regression. Then, based on its assessment, it will call either `evaluate_classification_dataset` or `evaluate_regression_dataset`, providing the appropriate dataset filename and target column. Both tools handle the technical aspects of machine learning (splitting the data, training the model, and calculating performance metrics) while abstracting away implementation details. For classification tasks, the agent will examine the target column's data type and unique values to determine if it's categorical, then call the classification evaluator, which returns accuracy metrics. For regression tasks involving continuous numerical predictions, the agent will select the regression evaluator that returns the R² score and mean squared error. This decision-making process showcases how a well-designed agent can choose the appropriate tool based on data characteristics, demonstrating intelligent workflow automation.\n"
