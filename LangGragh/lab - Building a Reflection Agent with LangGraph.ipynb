    "In this guided project, you'll learn to build Reflection agents using LangGraph, a powerful tool for creating self-improving AI systems. Reflection agents represent a significant advancement in AI capabilities - they can evaluate their own outputs, identify weaknesses, and iteratively improve through feedback loops. You'll start by understanding the concept of reflection in AI, then build a complete reflection agent that can generate content, evaluate its quality, and refine outputs through multiple iterations. Working with a LinkedIn post generator as your example, you'll implement a graph-based workflow that mimics human-like reflective thinking, enabling the agent to transform basic content into polished, engaging outputs. By the end of this project, you'll have hands-on experience creating AI systems that can think critically about their own work and continuously improve their performance.\n"

    "# What is Reflection?\n",
    "Reflection is a prompting strategy aimed at enhancing the quality and accuracy of outputs generated by AI agents. It involves getting the agent to **pause, review, and critique** its own outputs before finalizing them. This iterative process helps in reducing errors and improving performance over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, when an AI model generates code, it typically outputs the result instantly. However, just like human programmers, code needs to be tested and refined. Reflection ensures that the AI agent **evaluates the generated code, identifies potential errors, and iterates** to fix them. This mimics how developers write, test, debug, and optimize their work, resulting in more reliable outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple analogy is comparing it to having two systems:\n",
    "- **System 1** – Reactive and instinctive (quick initial responses).\n",
    "- **System 2** – Reflective and deliberate (carefully reviewing and refining outputs).\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Generation Node: Generate Initial Output**\n",
    "   - The first step in the process is the **generation node**, which quickly produces an initial output based on the given prompt. This stage is all about generating a first draft without focusing too much on perfection. It acts like an instinctive response, providing a rough version of the output. For example, if the task is to write a LinkedIn post, the generation node would come up with a basic idea. This draft is then passed to the next step for evaluation.\n",
    "     \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Evaluation Node: Evaluate Output for Quality**\n",
    "   - After the initial output is generated, the **evaluation node** assesses its quality. This step is about checking if the output is good enough or if it needs improvement. The evaluation focuses on key aspects like whether the message is clear, engaging, and relevant. For instance, in the case of a LinkedIn post, the evaluation might decide if the post feels authentic, aligns with professional tone, or misses important context. If the output is deemed acceptable, it moves forward to the final step.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Reflection Node: Critique and Refine**\n",
    "   - If the evaluation node determines that the output needs improvement, the **reflection node** steps in to refine the content. This step is more thoughtful and deliberate, where the system reflects on the output and looks for ways to improve it. The reflection node critiques the draft, suggests changes, and revises the content to make it more polished. It could involve enhancing tone, adding clarity, highlighting achievements, or making the post more engaging. The system keeps refining the output through this process until it reaches the desired quality level.\n",
    "     \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Final Output: Present Refined Result**\n",
    "   - Once the reflection node has done its job, the final output is produced. This is the result of the reflection and evaluation processes, where the initial draft has been refined and improved. The agent now presents the final version of the content — a polished, high-quality LinkedIn post ready for publishing. After this step, the process concludes, and the final response is delivered to the user.\n",
